🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict forest cover types using cartographic variables. It is a multi-class classification task where the model predicts one of seven forest cover types based on terrain and geographical features.

📌 Problem Statement
Given various spatial and environmental features (such as elevation, slope, soil type, etc.), the objective is to accurately classify the forest cover type of a given area. This has real-world applications in ecological management and geographic mapping.
